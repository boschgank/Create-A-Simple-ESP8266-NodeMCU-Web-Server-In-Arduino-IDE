# Create-A-Simple-ESP8266-NodeMCU-Web-Server-In-Arduino-IDE
Over the past few years, the ESP8266 has been a growing star among IoT or WiFi-related projects. It’s an extremely cost-effective WiFi module that – with a little extra effort – can be programmed to build a standalone web server.  The ESP8266 that creates its own WiFi network and acts as a hub (Just like WiFi router) for one or more stations is called Access Point (AP). Unlike WiFi router, it does not have interface to a wired network. So, such mode of operation is called Soft Access Point (soft-AP). Also the maximum number of stations that can connect to it is limited to five.
